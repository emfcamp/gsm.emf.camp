  How to connect to, and use, the EMF GSM network
---

# Requirements

You'll need one of our SIM cards, or a SIM card from a previous event that you've registered with us ([more about this](/sims/)).
Pop the size SIM you need out of the adapter, and insert it into your phone as you would normally. You might need to set your
phone's "preferred network type" to 2G.

Our network operates in the DCS-1800 [frequency band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM_frequency_bands)
(equivalent to LTE band 3). Most GSM phones for use in Europe should support this band, but check your phone's specifications if
you're unsure.

# First Steps

1. Register an number in the [Electromagnetic Phonebook](https://phones.emfcamp.org/), setting the type of service to GSM
2. Insert SIM card into phone
3. Dial 900, then enter your chosen number, and the activation code listed in the phonebook
4. Enjoy!

# Disclaimer

This network is an experiment! We can't commit to providing a reliable service, though we'll do our very best. Coverage might be
limited in places, too.

# Once connected

See our friends over at EMF POC for some example numbers to call [here](https://www.emfcamp.org/about/phones)

For services specific to the EMF GSM network, please see the [Services](/services/) page

If you need any help, come down to the phone helpdesk and we'll try and sort it out.
