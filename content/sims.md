  Buy one from us, or bring your c3gsm SIM!

Thanks to [c3gsm](https://c3gsm.de/), we'll have a stock of about 200 SIM cards to sell at the shop. Expect to pay
around Â£3 per SIM.

## Bringing your own

We need to know the [authentication keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_card#Authentication_key_(Ki)) of your SIM
in order for it to work on our network.

If you have a SIM card from a CCC event, like CCCamp23 or 37c3, you can ask [c3gsm](https://c3gsm.de/sim/) for the keys.
Make a note of the ICCID of your SIM card (it's written on the card itself!), and send that to
[ticket@c3gsm.de](mailto:ticket@c3gsm.de) along with a brief note asking them for the Ki and OPC values.

When you get the keys, send them to us at [poc@emfcamp.org](mailto:poc@emfcamp.org)
and we'll add them into our system.
