Some things may change or not be available at the 2024 event.

We are hoping to start updating the content on this site soon. (You can help out!)

We're running a small 2G network this year at EMF! With one of our SIM cards, you'll be able to call and text your friends on our
camp phone system; you'll just need a phone that supports GSM in the 1800 MHz frequency bands (most European phones do).

To get support and or talk to us about these services, join us in the [#emfcamp-lte IRC
channel](https://web.libera.chat/?channel=#emfcamp-lte) on [Libera Chat](https://libera.chat/) (ignore the LTE, maybe next time)

{{% alert title="Under construction" color="warning" %}}We're still working on these documentation pages, so not everything here will be accurate just yet. Check back closer to the event for more information!
