  Connecting to the Internet over the EMF GSM network

GPRS is experimentally available on the EMF GSM network, and any APN should work (`internet` is fine).

#Â WAP Gateway

{{% alert title="Note" color="warning" %}}This WAP gateway is graciously hosted by [Billy](https://billy.wales), and isn't on the rest of the EMF GSM infrastructure. Your traffic will leave the camp network in order to get there, and we can't guarantee support for it.
